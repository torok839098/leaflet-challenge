# leaflet-challenge
Visualizing earthquakes and developing ways to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on environmental issues.

In order to help visualize earthquakes in order to educate the public on environmental issues,
you'll need to:

* Create a new repository called leaflet-challenge. Do not add this Challenge to an existing repository.

* Clone the new repository to your computer. 

* Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Leaflet challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: Leaflet-Part-1 and Leaflet-Part-2 (optional).

* Both HTML and JavaScript will be used, so be sure to add all the necessary files. These will be the main files to run for analysis.

* Push the above changes to GitHub.

* Module 15 files 

##  Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
The task involves visualizing earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed. 
Link: 

* First, select a dataset from the provided link, such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days," and obtain its JSON representation. 

* Then, import and visualize the data using Leaflet, creating a map that plots all earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. 

* The data markers should reflect earthquake magnitude through size and depth through color, with higher magnitudes appearing larger and greater depths appearing darker. 

* Popups should provide additional earthquake information upon marker click, and a legend should provide context for the map data, resulting in a visualization similar to the provided map.

## Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional)
To illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity, you can plot a second dataset alongside the original earthquake data. 

* First, obtain the tectonic plates dataset from the provided link. Then, visualize both datasets on your map using Leaflet. 

* Add the tectonic plates dataset as an additional overlay alongside the earthquake data. Offer various base maps to choose from for enhanced visualization. 

* Organize each dataset into separate overlays, allowing users to toggle them on and off independently.

* Finally, incorporate layer controls into your map to facilitate easy toggling between datasets, providing users with a comprehensive visualization of tectonic plates and seismic activity.
